# Coffee_management

This project is a small interactive Python program that simulates a simple coffee ordering process.
It asks the customer for their name, presents a list of available drinks, calculates the total price
based on the quantity ordered, accepts payment, and prints a receipt.

## Features

- Displays a welcome message.
- Asks for the customer's first and last name.
- Shows a simple list of drinks.
- Allows the customer to choose a drink.
- Uses a fixed price of 200 FCFA per unit.
- Calculates the total cost based on the quantity requested.
- Asks for payment and calculates the change.
- Prints a detailed receipt with:
- The selected drink
- The quantity ordered
- The total price
- The amount given
- The change returned

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
The program uses basic Python features such as “print()”, “input()”, variables, and arithmetic
operations.

## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure Python is installed on your device.
2. Place first_project.py in any folder.
3. Open your terminal in that folder.
4. Run the script with:

```
python first_project.py

```

1. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Example Interaction

```
========== Welcome! ==========
Enter your name here -->: Alice
Enter your surname here -->: Kone
======= Coffee List =======
Lipton
Coffee
Milk
Chocolate Coffee
Enter the name of the drink you want -->: Coffee
Thank you! One unit of Coffee costs 200 FCFA.
How many do you want? -->: 3
Ok, that will cost you 600 FCFA.
Please give me the money -->: 1000
You took 3 unit(s) of Coffee.
Your total expenses are 600 FCFA.
You gave 1000 FCFA, so your change is 400 FCFA.
Thank you and enjoy your coffee!

```

## Possible Improvements

- Add different prices depending on the drink selected.
- Add error handling (invalid input, insufficient payment, unknown drink).
- Convert the script into a menu-based application.
- Use functions to structure the code more cleanly.
